## 🧠 Project Philosophy (Important)

Before contributing, please understand how RAI is built:

* RAI is **human-first**, not feature-first
* Simplicity is preferred over complexity
* Privacy and user control are core values
* RAI should **support and guide**, not manipulate
* Automation must always be **explicitly permitted**

If a feature violates these principles, it likely won’t be accepted.

---

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

* Write **clean, readable code**
* Follow language-specific best practices
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add comments where logic is non-obvious

### General Rules

* Keep functions small and focused
* Avoid unnecessary abstractions
* Prefer clarity over cleverness
* Write code as if someone else will maintain it

---

## 🧪 Testing

* New features should include basic tests where possible
* Bug fixes should include regression tests
* Make sure existing tests pass before submitting a PR

---

## 📝 Issues & Feature Requests

### Before Creating an Issue

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. For big ideas, start with a **discussion**

### Bug Reports Should Include:

* What happened
* What you expected
* Steps to reproduce
* Environment (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Feature Requests Should Include:

* The problem you want to solve
* Why it matters
* How it fits RAI’s vision
